    404
    Error message when what was requested cannot be found; often because the link that was requested is either broken or dead.
    
    API
    “Application Program Interface.” How computers and applications communicate with one another.
    
Application
    Also known as an app, these are programs designed to perform functions. This includes mobile apps.
    

Attribute
    Information about elements of a component in your website design/build.


Browser
    The program you use to access the Web — such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. When you experience an issue with a website, it’s best to send the browser type and version you’re using to your developer as oftentimes these issues are browser specific. You can figure this out easily thanks to WhatsMyBrowser.org.
    
Bug.
    An error or flaw in the website or app that keeps it from running as expected.
    
    Cache.
    The storage of certain elements to help with faster load times from repeat website visitors. Often developers will tell you to clear your browser’s cache if they make a change on the website that you can’t see — most likely your cache is holding onto an older version and hasn’t made room for the new one yet. (Kind of like that period of time between you moving to college and your parents converting your childhood bedroom into a home-office–slash–exercise-room.)
   
   Classes
    In CSS, an identifier for specifying exactly what you what to target with styling.
    In other programming languages, classes are a bit more broadly used as the blueprint for creating something — similar to using the blueprint of an existing car to create a new type of car.
    
    CMS
    “Content Management System.” The program that you use to create and maintain your website’s content. These are usually designed for non-developers for ease-of-use. Our personal favorite at Whole Whale is WordPress.
    Conversion.
    The goals you have for RGS (really good stuff) happening on your website, such as donations, email signups, and downloads. If your user and your website were in a relationship, this is when they would say “I love you.”
    
Cookies
    The source of all that is good, chocolatey, and sugary in the world… Kidding. (Sort of.) This is the data sent by an Internet server to a browser. Each time the browser accesses the same server, it sends the data back as a means of tracking how (and how often) it accesses the server. This is why your home computer always knows your Netflix login.

Crawl
    When search engines send bots to your website in order to gather intel on pages that exist and don’t exist in order to determine what content should be displayed or removed on search engines.
   
CRM.
    “Customer Relationship Management.” In website development this refers to the software and applications used to gather, analyze, and maintain information on customers, donors, and prospects.
    
CSS.
    “Cascading Style Sheet.” Code that tells browsers how to display a webpage for the end user. This programming formats fonts, colors, and other visual elements. When redeveloping a website, editing these elements in the mockup/GUI phase is much easier than changing in CSS.

CTA
    “Call to Action.” The buttons on your website that drive certain conversions or goals such as donations, newsletter signups, or user registrations.
    D

    DevOps
    “Development Operations.” System of working that helps to keep development, IT operations, and quality assurance departments on the same page to make for better end-products and collaborations.
    
Domain
    The address for a website as entered into the browser.

   Favicon
    Short for “favorite icon,” it’s the icon that appears in your website’s browser tab. (Ours is our mascot, Moby.)
    
Fields
    If you build it, they will come: The most basic of the building blocks for data collection. These are the storage units that your website visitors use to enter their names, email addresses, notes, etc. If you’re asking for first name, last name, email address, city, and zip code across five different entry boxes, that’s five fields.
    
Firewall
    System to protect a secure network from an unsecure network (i.e., the rest of the Internet).
    
Framework
    Suite of programs used in website or software development. This lays the groundwork for the type of programming language used for your site or app development.
    
FTP
“File Transfer Protocol.” Method of exchanging files from one computer to another. This is also how websites are uploaded to the Internet.
    
    GUI
    “Graphical User Interface.” The image of how a website is laid out and meant to be interacted with. In website design, this is how everything will ideally look in layout (your mileage may vary when you move into development given the number of different browsers and versions).

    HTML
    “Hypertext Markup Language.” The coding language used to build a website in terms of both form and function.
    
Meta Tag
    Additional information on web pages or elements, such as the way a piece of content should display in Google search results, the photo credit for an image, or the main keywords associated with a plugin. This is huge for SEO. We recommend the Yoast plugin on WordPress for adding all of the necessary meta information to set up your site for SEO success.
    
    Navigation
    Links on a homepage that break down the other pages of a website. This can be both in the menu at the top of a site or in a footer (preferably both).
    
    OOTB
    “Out of the Box.” Also known as “Off the Shelf.” These are the ready-made, plug-and-play options for features and functions that you can download and install without the need to customize or configure. Instead of making the brownies from scratch, you’re using the mix (either way, it’s still tasty).
    
Opening/Closing Tags
    Angle brackets (< >) that bookend an HTML element to help build the structure of a webpage. Closing tags include a forward slash (</>). For example, if we were going to italicize part of this sentence, we would open with <i> and close with </i>.
   
    Page Template
    The layout for a webpage — pages that have similar structures share the same template (such as event detail pages for a variety of events on the same website). Pages that are radically different use separate templates.
  
 Plugin
    Modules or software that can be added (“plugged in”) to a system for added functionality or features.

    Property
    Characteristics that are dictated by CSS such as color schemes and fonts.
    
    Redirects
    Automatic forwards from one URL to another — usually from an old website URL to the same page on a new website (these are called 301 Redirects). Other redirects may pivot between two domains (e.g., idealist.com redirects to idealist.org), a shortened URL to the full URL (e.g., bit.ly URLs), and geotargeted URLs.
    
Registrar
    Company used to register domains (e.g., GoDaddy, Hover, Network Solutions).

    Resolution
    Essentially how large an image or graphic can be rendered on a display.

    Responsive Design
    Websites that accommodate the screen on which they’re being viewed. i.e. mobile-first” approac
    
    SAAS Platforms
    “Software As A Service.” The most basic of cloud platforms; allows users to share files and collaborate on projects through their browser. Some SAAS platforms include Google Drive and Dropbox. Other cloud options are Platform as a Service (PAAS; Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS; Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure).

    Server
    Computers running software that allows users to access your website — this is what houses the hosting. If your domain is the website’s mailing address and the hosting is its house, the server is the land it’s built on.

    Sitemap
    Outline of all pages on a website, organized in hierarchical order — much like the outlines you used to use for your college term papers.

    Slider
    Carousel of images usually featured on the homepage of a site that rotate, highlighting different photos, links, and content.
   
    
    UI
    “User Interface.” The visual elements that go into a website or app. This is the form to UX’s function.
    
UX
    “User Experience.” A user’s interaction with an interface with a focus on how satisfying and successful the experience is. The function to complement UI’s form.
    
    Widgets
    Applications that allow for specific interactive functions to be performed on a website.

    Wireframe
    The bare bones structure of a website. No fonts, colors, or images, this layout is the first step to making sure that the foundation is sound before content is added.

    WYSIWYG
    “What You See is What You Get.” A visual content editor within CMS that allows you to modify content in your website without needing to know HTML. If you’ve ever made text in your website bold just by highlighting and clicking “Bold,” you were using WYSIWYG.


Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)
used by developers to request dynamic asynchronous page content through JS.

Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)
A public data set released by Google Developers to demonstrate how real Chrome users experience websites “in the wild”. You can access this data set from 

Client-side Rendering (CSR)
The execution of JavaScript and supplied data within a web browser, resulting in an interactive DOM for browsing.

Compression
A method of reducing the overall size of a file. This can be through various methods which broadly speaking either reduces the file contents and then uses GZIP compression for transport.

Content Delivery Network (CDN)
A usually global network of server clusters which can host and distribute your website pages and/or assets to users at a faster speed than your own server. Also comes with additional benefits such as security, and sometimes denial of service protection.Content Management System (CMS)
An interactive dynamic web application allowing simple interaction with a database to create, update and delete objects and entitles, such as pages, blog posts, products and more. Research “WordPress” if this is new to you.

Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
An HTTP protocol via additional HTTP headers that tells browsers to give a web application access to selected resources from a different/external origin.

Decoupled CMS
Very similar to a Headless CMS but a more literal interpretation of the decoupling of the application from the CMS application entirely.

Document Object Model (DOM)
An API for programming HTML and XML documents. The DOM describes the logical structure of the nested nodes in a document and defines how the document can be accessed and modified.

Dynamic Rendering
Switching content serving at the server/edge-level based on user-agent strings, to ensure bots receive rendered HTML not empty SPA containers.

ECMAScript 6, ES6, ECMA Script 2015
Version 6 of the JS programming language

First Contentful Paint (FCP)
The point when the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM, which may be any visible element.

First Meaningful Paint (FMP)
As described by Google Developers, First meaningful paint (FMP) is the metric that answers the question: “is it useful?”. This varies from site to site, but is the point in time that the browser renders useful content for the user from the DOM.

Headless CMS
A headless CMS is a content management system that is front-end agnostic, that means you can “bring your own” Single Page Application to render the content from the CMS via APIs.

Hybrid Rendering
The process of sending a selected amount of content, that you want to be indexed by search engine bots, as static HTML to the user and the search engine bot. From here, you can then run JavaScript to enhance the user experience and to reduce the resource needed from Googlebot to fully interpret your website.

Hydration/Rehydration
Hydration involves the process where a framework, such as Vue.js, obtains data from the server which is then populated in the browser’s interactive DOM. Hydration can be performed server-side under server side rendered setups. Rehydration happens where previously hydrated content served as static HTML from the server is then picked up and enhanced by a SPA to become interactive once more.

Isomorphic JavaScript
or "Universal JavaScript", JS web apps which run both on the client and the server.

JAMStack
A new web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, APIs, and prebuilt Markup (J A M).

JavaScript (JS)
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that can power server side and client side web applications.

JavaScript Framework
A JavaScript framework is an application framework written in JavaScript. It defines the entire application design, unlike a JavaScript library which offers functions to be called in code.

JavaScript Library
A collection of useful code which provides functions to be called by the application code.

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
A file standard consisting of key-value data pairs. Can be used to transmit arrays, strings, and serializable objects between systems. Due to popularity and portability, it also often replaces the XML file format in JSON communications.

Loading Performance
A performance optimisation practises which focuses on load order, file efficiency and compression (amongst others) which aims to make a web application/website render and paint faster in a web browser.

Markdown
Markdown is a popular and easy to access markup language most typically used for writing developer documentation. Its simple syntax also lends itself to managing static websites through being a static data source.

Minification
The procedure of removing any irrelevant spaces, comments and characters to save on the overall loading time caused by file size. This can be achieved through command line build tools or popular CMS plugins.

Multi Page Application (MPA)
A description of a traditional website that has multiple singular page loads. The opposite of a SPA, whereby each individual page visit causes a browser load event. 

Pre-render
Using a web service to produce HTML snapshots of website pages in advance in order to serve to Bot requests.

Progressive Web Application (PWA)
A PWA is a website application that effectively uses modern website capabilities to pass over an app-like experience to the users. The high-quality PWA should deliver a reliable, fast and engaging experience that benefits the end user. Features of PWAs include offline browsing, push notifications and background syncing and updates.

Render
The process of a web browser fetching data within a website’s code and turning this into an output of a viewable page. 

Render Blocking Source
As resources are loaded into the <head> of a document, they are by default usually render blocking. This means they prevent the rendering to the browser until their loading is complete. CSS and JavaScript files are by default render blocking. It’s important to fully optimise these files and where possible load the JavaScript files asynchronously to prevent this delay to the rendering.

Rendering Performance
A performance optimisation practise which focuses on server-side technology to produce static HTML and optimised application code to serve to users and internet bots.

Server-side Rendering (SSR)
A catch-all definition of a number of methods to produce static HTML files from JavaScript application code on the server.

Single Page Application (SPA)
A SPA is a modern dynamic web application programmed in JavaScript that runs within a browser. This process helps to serve an excellent UX with no page reloads and lack of excess waiting time. Instead of full page reloads between page views, like an MPA, a Single Page Application dynamically includes changing sections of a page when requested, leading to a much-improved user experience.

Static Site Generation
This describes a type of website that is stored on the server as static HTML files, with no server-side processing. It can be built from a JAMStack web application but is stored in it’s “built” form. Once compiled into static files, these are usually then published to the server or content delivery network.

Time to First Byte (TTFB)
TTFB is the length of time taken for your browser to receive the first byte of the initial response from your website’s server. You can test this with the WebPageTest tool that will deliver granular performance results https://www.webpagetest.org/.

Time to Interactive (TTI)
TTI measures the time until a page is fully rendered for a user and responding to a user. Even once a page is fully or partially painted in a browser, if tasks are executing it may not be reliably responsive for users until this is completed. Code improvements will improve this.

Universal Rendering
The process of sending an application that has been fully rendered within the primary payload to the browser.

Web Rendering Service (WRS)
A headless browser than transforms HTML and JavaScript into something that can be displayed to a user or interpreted by an algorithm. The WRS comes to the site as a unique user would, with no cookies, permissions allowed to gain a holistic view of the website.
